You know the rules and so do I

4
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:31,087
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of

5
00:00:31,087 --> 00:00:35,081
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it

16
00:01:09,284 --> 00:01:12,744
Inside we both know what's been going on

17
00:01:12,744 --> 00:01:16,928
We know the game and we're gonna play it

18
